####Enemy Types:

|Enemy_Types|Description|
|--------|:---------------------------------------------------------------|
|Boss |A boss is the strongest enemy in a dungeon or any other location. They are difficult to beat and sometimes are cannot be beaten unless their weakness is found.
|Miniboss| They are basically weak bosses. They are strong, but not really unbeatable. It is common to gain a weapon by defeating them and that allows the player to defeat the boss in that location.
|Enemy | Simple to defeat. Should not take more that a few projectiles or sword hits to take down.

####Enemy Attack Patterns:

These attack patterns are normally used by all enemies. Some foes are only one of these types, but minibosses and bosses normally have more than one type.

|Attack_Pattern|Description|
|-------------|:----------------------------------------------------------|
|-flation| This boss either gets bigger after each strike the player inflicts on it or smaller. The hero and boss become easier to hit when the boss inflates. When the boss deflates it takes a longer time to get to the hero and its small size might be hard to hit because it is not a big balloon.
|Item| This boss is normally impossible to beat as long as he has his special item. (Staff, ring, etc)
|Condition| This is a normal type of enemy. Requires one weapon to defeat it.
|Multi-condition| This type of enemy is normally a boss. Sometimes the hero will have attack more than just the boss to do damage. For example, the hero will have to take out the bubbles, hit the enemy with an arrow, and strike it with the sword to make the enemy take damage.
|Wack the Whistle|This enemy hides in a hole and comes out to attack.
|Terrain| This type of enemy uses the terrain to attack the hero. For example, falling spikes or rocks. Also, it can spin the terrain or bump up the edges to make the hero go off balance.
|Grab and throw| This type of enemy grabs and throws the hero.
|One with Terrain| This type of enemy becomes one with the terrain. For example, an enemy can cover itself with water and attack. A good way to defeat this type would to know where the core is.
|The Phantom| A enemy that normally floats, becomes invisible, and hides in a shadow. An item is normally needed to see it and/or light based attacks to cause damage. A phantom can use curses to hurt the hero when they try to cause damage. That curse only lasts a few seconds or a condition needs to be met to break it.
|The deflectors| The projectile attacks need to be deflected and bounced back at the enemy in order for the foe to take damage. The enemy might be able to deflect back.
|Projectile seeker| This enemy shoots projectiles and sometimes the projectile will follow the hero.
|Hammer|This type of enemy rises in the air and slams down to the ground like a hammer.
|Clone|These types of enemies can clone themselves and the only way to defeat them is to take out the original or quickily defeat them all.
|limp-flation| This enemy either inflates its limps to make them bigger or ejects their limbs like a hookshot. This type of enemy normally protects its limps, so it will not take damage.
|Floor mover| This type of enemy works with the floors. It can change its location and bounce off the walls at a rapid pace. For example, they can bounce off the walls by bouncing, spinning, climbing, using magic, flipping, and with their blades.
|The magician| The magician is similar to the Phantom, but it normally uses magic tricks. For example, runs into a mirror, teleport, strikes with magic, turns into objects, protects itself in a hat, etc.
|Dark hero| This is a dark version of the hero. Normally encountered in other worlds or dimensions.
|Weapon| This type of enemy fight with weapons.
|Distancer| This enemy normally hides on the ceiling, jumps on pillars, and/or flys at a distance. That way this flying foe does not take damage until it comes down to attack.
|Duplicator| This type of enemy divides based on the damage that is being taken.
|Color warning| This enemy display warnings that tells the hero what kind of attack it will use or how rapid its strikes will be. It does not have to be colors to be honest.
|Monster commander| This type of enemy can produce weaker enemies to attack the hero.
|Suicide Bomber| This type of enemy kills itself to harm the hero in an explosion.
|Time traveler| This enemy can restore its health by time traveling its body. A normal effect is that it gets distorted and weakened as it keeps doing it.
|The eater| This type of enemy eats the hero for a short time and spits the hero out.
|Damaged by terrain only| This enemy can only be harmed by something in the terrain. A special root or statue with special powers.
|Drag down| This type of enemy drags the hero down. Normally resulting in going to a different floor.
|Transformer| This enemy changes and gets stronger the more it is attacked.

####Puzzles:

Everyone knows that puzzles are very important in any RPG. The wonder of knowing what will happen when solving them or just the wanting to defeat the annoying bugger. 

|Puzzle_Type|Description|
|-------|:---------------|
|Puzzles:| A puzzle is a game, problem, or toy that tests a person's ingenuity or knowledge. In a puzzle, one is required to put the pieces together in a logical way, in order to arrive at the correct solution of the puzzle. Many beings can tell puzzles, whether they are magical or not. 
|Block Puzzle| The Block Puzzle involves moving shapes or plain blocks into a certain position, or the rearranging of blocks to form an image/picture. This may be to press a switch, to create a step which can be used to gain high ground, to put blocks color/colour order, move the block into a hole, etc. 
|Return Puzzle|The most common puzzle is the return puzzle, a puzzle in which a player must depart from a room and return again with an extra item or key, making that room passable. This can be the case with dungeon rooms with multiple exits.
|Enemy Puzzle|The Enemy Puzzle involves a room or area in which one or several enemies must be defeated to move on. There are three common forms. Enemy, miniboss, and boss. <br><br>Multiple foes: This is where the player has to defeat multiple enemies in the same room. They are normally much weaker than the hero and sometimes they must be defeated in a certain order. A rewards can be gained from defeating the enemies in different orders.<br><br>Mini Boss: The mini boss is normally encountered inside dungeons. The common reward is a new weapon or item for their defeat. Sometimes they even use an item similar to what the player will gain. They are often difficult to defeat, but not as hard as a boss.<br><br>The boss: The player must defeat this enemy in order to pass or beat a dungeon. They are normally the most difficult foe in the dungeon to defeat. The hero normally becomes stronger in some way due to defeating them. For example, the strength gain can be more health or stronger strikes against certain types of foes.
|Switch Puzzle|Switches in the form of levers and buttons are used quite often and many more types can be used. For example, crystals, organic organs, and other things can be used as switches. There is really no limit on the type of switch.
|Lever:| Needs to be pushed or pulled. Some inaccessible levers require use of the Hookshot (pull), Seed/nut Shooter (push), or Bombs (for timing).
|Button:| Many types exist, but can be broken down into the form of weight. The weight of a block might need to be removed from a button or weight might need to be put on it, sometimes there is an item to use if the player is not heavy enough to push it. The switches can have a timer on them, meaning the player might need to hurry or the switch will have to be stepped on again.
|Target Puzzle:|The Target Puzzle is normally used to open a door or in some way to help the hero reach the next floor. For example, shooting an object above a door, with a projectile weapon, can open that door. The puzzle can be made more difficult in a few ways. For example, the target can be moving or the movement might be from a platform the player is standing on. Furthermore, other objects or enemies might be moving in the hero's way! Another example, can be to activate floating objects in a certain order to reach the next floor. Weapons used are normally slingshot, bow, crossbow, and gun.
|Force of Nature Puzzles:|I have noticed that wind and other forces of nature can be used to make puzzles as well. The player or objects like a bomb can move to certain points and be shot around due to the forces, like wind or maybe even plant life.
|Torch puzzle:|This might be considered a force of nature, but this deserves a whole puzzle of its own. The Torch Puzzle involves the lighting of one or more torches by fire in order to receive access to another room, treasure chest, or something similar. 
|Riddle Puzzle:|This is normally a word based puzzle and can require doing a type of action or even wearing certain garment. Sometimes bad occurrences can happen for getting the answer wrong. The player or character can be hurt/killed, or be forced to fight a bunch of enemies. A lot of time there can be more deadly cases, but not many people do this anymore. The player's life force can decrease permanently, etc. For example, you could be cursed permanently or for a certain amount of time. The curse could have a good side too, and another riddle might be needed to break it! Do you want to?
|Location Change Puzzle:|Locations can be used as puzzles. For example, the location might look exactly the same, no matter where the player goes. The player is not "always" teleporting to the same spot, but is going to a similar location. The Lost Woods in Zelda is a good example. Also, areas or dungeon rooms can switch in a different order. This might not always be a puzzle because it could be completely random. Another example, time can be used to follow a character in a location and if the player gets too far behind, then the player will not be able to pass the puzzle for getting to the next location.

####Quest Types

One must think of quest types in order to make a proper story. Meeting characters can involve rescue quests, etc. Also, do not think that quests types will make your game unique every time because many characters have something unique about them. It can be a weird personality flaw, a way of living or something different about their body, but we will get more into that later. Let us start with quest types!

|Quest_Type|Description|
|:------:|:-----|
|Kill quests|The character must go out and kill a specific number of creature types, or a particular non-player character and the short way to say that is NPC. These kinds of quests involve bringing back evidence of success, such as trophies or something belonging to the being. (Staff, tusks, head, etc.)
|Combo quests|The player will attack certain foes or structures with a combination of attacks until the necessary number of combos has been reached. Foes in these quests are normally either immortal or infinite in amount until the player character is victorious in which the foes would be eliminated or stop appearing.
|Delivery quests|A quest type called the delivery quest or fetch-carry quest. This is a situation where the character is sent to deliver or obtain an item from one place to another. In certain cases the character might need to collect the object first instead of being handed the item to deliver when beginning the quest. These quests are created to be difficult by asking the character to journey through different or dangerous terrain, sometimes with a time limit.
|Gather quests|Gather quests, also known as collection quests, call for a player character to collect a specific amount of items. These can either be gathered from a place or environment, or need the player to kill creatures to obtain the required items. The quest could also require the character to gather a number of different items. For example, to assemble a device.
|Escort quests|The Escort quest is a combination of defeating creatures to protect a non-player character(s) all while investigating an area alongside that Non-player character (NPC). A normal escort quest would have the player defending a NPC as he, it (3rd,4th, etc gender), or she moves through a monster-infested area. Most of the time the quest will force the player to kill many monsters to ensure the well-being of the NPC. Escort quests can be beneficial, in making the player's pay attention to a particular spot in order to play out a scene or reveal a section of the plot. They can also be used to transport a character from one location to another, leading the player along a route or path. However, problems with this type of quest can occur if the artificial intelligence controlling the NPC causes them to behave in unexpected or unmanageable ways. Because many of them are often done wrong, they are very unpopular among the gaming community. 
|Syntax quests|A phenomenon unique to text-based games, syntax quests depend on guessing the correct syntax to use to carry out a (typically simple) operation. For instance, arranging stone tablets in a certain order to make a picture or figuring out how to read the sentence and carrying out a certain action. It mostly involves arranging something in a certain order to figure out the meaning.
|Hybrids|Parts of the above quest types can be put together to make more complex quests. For instance, a quest could need that the player locate the pieces needed to assemble a certain weapon or item (Gather Quest) and then use it to defeat a specific foe (Kill quest). Hybrid quests can also involve puzzles and riddles.
|Quest chains|A quest chain is a group of quests that are completed in sequence they are also known as quest lines. Completion of each quest is a prerequisite to beginning the next quest in the chain. Quests usually heighten in toughness as a character goes further along the chain. The quests normally shows a single plotline in an order that explains the reason for the quests. Quest chains can also start with the opening or breadcrumb quests, in order to encourage characters to journey to a new area, where further elements of the quest chain are revealed. Through mechanisms like these, the setting of a particular location is explained to the player, with the plot or storyline being unveiled as the character progresses.

####Map Design

Map design can take up a lot of time. It is best to get quick ideas from generators. [Donjon Dungeon Generator](http://donjon.bin.sh/fantasy/dungeon/wallpaper.cgi)

Telling you how to design your map is almost impossible because there is no right way, but I will give basic tips.

|Tip|Description|
|:-----:|:-----|
|Cludder| Do not put too many objects on one map unless it is like a junk yard or something like that.
|Duplicate objects| The same objects all over the place would look weird. The same flower pot appearing in a room 10 times would look unnatural.
|Spacing| Try to keep decent space when making a map. For example, one will want to get around the chair.
|Larger Rooms| Small rooms are okay for houses, but in main locations they should be a bit more complex. For example, a square room after every door might get boring.
|Outline| One should outline the map with basic tiles first because if one were to change things later after mapping, then it might look bad or a lot of things might need to be moved around. A complete map redesign can be needed in some cases when a change is decided.
|Doors| Doors are always good to have because there is just that wonder of what is on the other side. Having the door locked is even better because it is like a forbidden special place.
|Plant Life| Plant life (EX: Vines) around windows and other places can make maps look natural and not so plain.
|Stairs|Going up to another level or floor can be as exciting as opening a door. What is up there? A stairway that is blocked can be more interesting.
|Hidden Floors| Finding hidden floors can make the hero feel special and enjoy exploring the map more.
|World Name| The world having a name can help you with your map organization. You do not want to get lost in over 100 maps.
|Challenging| Getting through a map too easily can be a drag! Make it at least a little tough or have some locations that can be seen, so the player will not want to leave the map as soon as possible.
|Heal Spots|Having spots to rest and people there to give one information is good way to not make a player mad while playing the game.

####Sidescroller: Some Information

Sidescrollers or Platformers are normally constant action and almost no dialog. The movement normally never stops and the player stomps on or fights enemies all the way. This type differs from an ARPG in many ways. An ARPG is normally based on exploration with a top-down view (under a 3/4 perspective) and a platformer is just a straight line most of the time. Sidescroller graphics are always a side camera view. Sidescrollers can be anything someone wants them to be though. Some people mix ARPG and sidescroller or make the sidescroller a journey instead of constant action.

![Chapter_Game_design_Sidescroller_example_1.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Sidescroll_preview_images/Chapter_Game_design_Sidescroller_example_1.png)

####Basic Story Making\Genre:

Genre is the term for any category of entertainment. Pick the genre you like most. I will only being adding genre I like to the book, so check wiki for more and greater detail into ones I listed. I will add this to the github. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_genres

|Genre|Description|
|:------:|:-------|
|Action Adventure|  Journeys to places and gets through obstacles along way. Normally fighting enemies, making an escape, and saving people.
|Fantasy|  A fantasy story is about magic or supernatural forces. 
|Horror|  A horror story is told to scare or frighten the people. Normally with suspense, shock and/or violence.
|Mystery|  A mystery story is normally about someone attempting to solve a puzzle. 
|Science fiction|  Centered around technology (computers and machines), universes space/time travel, aliens, and genetic manipulation. EX: Steampunk, cyberpunk, and clockpunk. Science fiction is mixed a lot in future eras and time travel.

####The Plot:

One has to know what the genre will be and what their hero or villain does. The hero does not always have to be the good guy and can do good or bad deeds in a story. 

|Quick Plot Example:|
|:-----|
|The hero Froyotay Grayerv sets out to destroys a peaceful advanced alien race because their touch can make humans immortal, but result in a mutated virus that makes humans unable to breed. He must fight to the death and find a way to rid himself of the curse that has been brought on by the mutation or else he will never be able to go home to his planet Dexerath.

###Outline styles

**Tips before getting into outlines:**

Outlining is a big part of game development. The second would be dialogue, but a lot of time the main character normally does not talk. The main difference between story writing and game writing is outline. What do I mean? The only thing needed to start the creation of a game is an outline and then simple dialogue or almost none at all. (Story writing is way more descriptive.) For example, an outline is needed to know how to make the artwork and what lands or kingdoms to set up. Also, names of the characters are needed and how they will look or what appeal type (Medieval or futuristic clothing?) they need. The type of outline depends on you.

####Mind Mapping Software:
Bubble outlining is kinda like mind mapping I would normally do this on paper, but maybe others prefer differently. - Give thanks to Renkineko for mentioning mind mapping.
