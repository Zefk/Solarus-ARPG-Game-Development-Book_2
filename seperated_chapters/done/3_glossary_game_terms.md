It is common in action games for the player character to have multiple lives and chances to earn more during the game. This way, a player can recover from making a disastrous mistake.
|Loot system|Methods used in multiplayer games to distribute treasure among cooperating players for finishing a quest. While early MMOs distributed loot on a 'first come, first served' basis, it was quickly discovered that such a system was easily abused, and later games instead used a 'need-or-greed' system, in which the participating players roll virtual 'dice' and the loot is distributed according to the results.

|MOBA|Abbreviation of Multiplayer online battle arena
|Mod|A third-party addition or alteration to a game. Mods may take the form of new character skins, altered gameplay mechanics or the creation of a new story or an entirely new game-world.

|Role-playing video game (RPG)|An RPG is a game where in the human player takes on the role of a specific character "class" and advances the skills and abilities of that character within the game environment. RPG characters generally have a wide variety of skills and abilities available to them, and much theorycrafting (the art of developing a specific character type to its highest in-game potential) is involved in creating the best possible form of each of these character classes.<br><br>This is different from games such as First Person Shooters (FPS), wherein the "player character" in those games are all standardized forms and the physical skills of the player involved are the determining factor in their success or failure within the game. In an RPG, a human player can be the best player in the world at the game, but if they are using a character build that is substandard, they can be significantly outplayed by a lesser player running a more optimal character build.
|Rush (or Zerg rush)|A tactic in strategy games where the player sacrifices economic development in favour of using many low-cost fast/weak units to rush and overwhelm an enemy by attrition or sheer numbers.

The term is in reference to a child's sandbox in which no rules are present and play is derived from open-ended choice. While some sandbox games may have building and creation aspects to their gameplay, those activities are not required. Sandbox games usually take place in an open-world setting as to facilitate the freedom of choice a player is given.
|Side quest|A quest that is optional, completing these won't advance the main story line (Main quest).
|Simulation game (Sim)|A video game that simulates some aspect of reality, though the degree of realism may vary. They are usually open-ended and have no intrinsic goals to be met. Inclusive definitions allow for any video game that models reality, such as sports games, while exclusive definitions generally focus on city-building games, vehicle simulation games, or both.
|Single-player|A game that can only have one player at a time. Contrasted with multiplayer.
|Skill tree|A character development gaming mechanic typically seen in role-playing games. A skill tree consists of a series of skills (sometimes known as perks or by other names) which can be earned by the player as he or she levels up or otherwise progresses his or her player character. These skills grant gameplay benefits to the player; for example, giving the character the ability to perform a new action, or giving a boost to one of the character's stats. A skill tree is called a "tree" because it uses a tiered system and typically branches out into multiple paths.
|Split-screen multiplayer|A game that presents 2 or more views seen by different players in a multiplayer game on the same display unit.
|Stat point|A discrete amount of points for the player to distribute among their character's attributes, e.g., to choose their player's trade-offs between strength, charisma, and stamina.
|Status effect|This is an overarching term that covers both "buffs" and "debuffs". Essentially, any effect to a character that is outside of the normal baseline is a "status effect". Common negative status effects are poisoning (damage over time), petrification/paralysis (inability to move), or armor/damage reduction (lowering of defensive/offensive abilities). Common positive status effects include a heal-over-time (a small, pulsing heal that triggers multiple times over a set period), armor/damage increases, or speed increases.
|Title screen|The initial screen of a computer, video, or arcade game after the credits and logos of the game developer and the publisher are displayed. Earlier title screens often included all the game options available (single player, multiplayer, configuration of controls, etc.) while modern games have opted for the title screen to serve as a splash screen. This can be attributed to the use of the title screen as a loading screen, in which to cache all the graphical elements of the main menu. Older computer and video games had relatively simple menu screens, that often featured pre-rendered artwork.
|Touchscreen|When the screen of the console can be touched and get a response.
|Turn-based game|When a game consists of multiple turns. When one player's turn is up, they must wait until everyone else has finished their turn.
|Upgrade|A way to make the given item, character, etc. more powerful.
|World|A series of levels that share a similar environment or theme. A boss fight will typically happen once all or most of these levels are completed rather than after each individual level.
|XP|Abbreviation of Experience Point
|Zero-day patch|A software patch that is set to be released on the day of the game's official release ("the 0th day"), reflecting updates and fixes that were added after the final release candidate was prepared.
|Sprite (computer graphics)|In computer graphics, a sprite is a two-dimensional bitmap that is integrated into a larger scene.
|Pixel|In digital imaging, a pixel, pel, dots, or picture element is a physical point in a raster image, or the smallest addressable element in an all points addressable display device; so it is the smallest controllable element of a picture represented on the screen.

|Sound Novel|A Sound Novel is a type of visual novel. The term is a trademark by Chunsoft and emphasizes the sound aspects as opposed to visual aspects. Sound novels are actually older than visual novels but because of the trademark the term "visual novel" is the one that's stuck in the long term. For older games the distinction between the two is somewhat notable, but for most modern games there's basically no difference between the meaning of the two terms.
|Kinetic Novel|A Kinetic Novel is a type of visual novel without any gameplay at all. That includes things like making decisions for the protagonist. Because of the lack of any player input, the story is entirely preset and the player just reads through it without any input. These are quite close to ordinary novels with added graphics, sound, and typically more focus on dialogue. Planetarian would be an example of such a game. Kinetic novels are usually shorter than other visual novels, though there are exceptions to this like Higurashi.
|Dating Sims|Dating Sims are a different category of game from Visual Novels. These games do feature gameplay, but the object of the gameplay is to get into a romantic relationship with a character from the game. The most familiar example is probably the Tokimeki Memorial series, though there are many other highly successful examples such as Love Plus. Unlike visual novels, the gameplay here can be fairly complex.
|Visual novel|Visual Novel (ビジュアルノベル), often shortened to VN, is a general type of game with a lot of dialogue and minimal gameplay (usually the gameplay is reduced to just making choices at a few plot points to determine what route one enters). It may or may not involve any romance or sexual encounters. For example, Danganronpa could qualify as a visual novel, but probably not for any of the other categories here. A more canonical example would be Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, though purists will sometimes insist on calling it a "Sound Novel" as this is the official description. More on this in the related terms section. Calling something a visual novel emphasizes the "novel" aspect and suggests that there is at least some semblance of a story. It would not usually be used to describe eroge which are solely sex scenes.<br><br>Visual novel can also be used in a more technical way to describe games where the text is overlayed over the background as opposed to being presented in dialogue boxes. This distinction is more common among Japanese speakers than English speakers. In English usually people will abbreviate this as NVL, and games where the dialogue is in a box at the bottom of the screen are called ADV. Fate/Stay Night is an example of this style.
|Eroge|Eroge (エロゲ) is a Japanese shortening of "erotic game". These can also be called H-games. Native Japanese speakers sometimes use the term to describe games without any sexual content (e.g. Clannad), but in English this isn't really a correct use of the term. Eroge can be any game with sex scenes (also called H-scenes). This includes some games that are not traditionally included as visual novels or dating sims. For example, Kamidori Alchemy Meister is an example of a game without a great deal of visual novel content but which still qualifies as an eroge.

|Artificial intelligence (AI)|Artificial intelligence is used to generate intelligent behaviors primarily in non-player characters (NPCs), often simulating human-like intelligence. The techniques used typically draw upon existing methods from the field of artificial intelligence (AI).
|Beat 'em up|Beat 'em up (also known as brawler) is a video game genre featuring hand-to-hand combat between the protagonist and an improbably large number of opponents. These games typically take place in urban settings and feature crime-fighting and revenge-based plots, though some games may employ historical, sci-fi or fantasy themes. Traditional beat 'em ups take place in scrolling, two-dimensional (2D) levels
|Central processing unit (CPU)|A central processing unit (CPU) is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logical, control and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions.
|Camera:|The camera is what follows the character around. It causes the screen to scroll with the player character.
|Cheats Codes:|Special codes that allow you bypass the normal limitations of a game.
|Spawning|Spawning is the live creation of a character, item or mob. Respawning is the recreation of an entity after its death or destruction, perhaps after losing one of its lives.
|Shoulder buttons: (Triggers)|Shoulder buttons are found on the back of modern controllers.
