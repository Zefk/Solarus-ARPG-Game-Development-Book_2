##Chapter 4: Using the Sprite editor

###Resource Manager > Sprites > Sprite Editor:

You can add a sprite character by putting a sprite image in the sprites directory and add it by right clicking. When one double clicks on a sprite the sprite editor appears. You will have to make a .dat file. For example, `slime_green.dat` for `slime_green.png`.

#####Resource Manager > Sprites > Sprite Editor > Sprite Properties:

You can add various different types of movements in the sprite editor. You can use the green plus(+) sign to add new ones. The other options allow duplicating an animation, deleting(x) an animation, and renaming them.

#####Resource Manager > Sprites > Sprite Editor > Animation Properties:

There are many options when it comes to the animation properties. 

1.Setting an animation as default

2.Selecting a source image

3.Frame delay

4.Loop on a certain frame number. Ex: Loop on frame 0

![Chapter_4_images/Chapter_4_3_Sprite_editor_sprite_animation_properties.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_4_images/Chapter_4_3_Sprite_editor_sprite_animation_properties.png)

#####Resource Manager > Sprites > Sprite Editor > Direction Properties:

The `direction properties` contains dimension options that allows one to easily set up a sprite.

1.Size

2.Position

3.Origin

4.Number of frames

5.Number of columns

![Chapter_4_4_Sprite_editor_sprite_direction_properties.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_4_images/Chapter_4_4_Sprite_editor_sprite_direction_properties.png)

#####Resource Manager > Sprites > Sprite Editor > Direction Properties > Size:

This is what it looks like when the size is changed. I Changed the size from 24 x 24 to 12 x 12.

![Chapter_4_5_Sprite_editor_sprite_direction_properties_size_1.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_4_images/Chapter_4_5_Sprite_editor_sprite_direction_properties_size_1.png)

*The result:*

![Chapter_4_6_Sprite_editor_sprite_direction_properties_size_2.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_4_images/Chapter_4_6_Sprite_editor_sprite_direction_properties_size_2.png)

#####Resource Manager > Sprites > Sprite Editor > Direction Properties > Position:

This is what it looks like when the position is changed from 0 x 0 to 20 x 20 .

![Chapter_4_7_Sprite_editor_sprite_direction_properties_position_1.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_4_images/Chapter_4_7_Sprite_editor_sprite_direction_properties_position_1.png)

*The result:*

![Chapter_4_8_Sprite_editor_sprite_direction_properties_position_2.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_4_images/Chapter_4_8_Sprite_editor_sprite_direction_properties_position_2.png)

#####Resource Manager > Sprites > Sprite Editor > Direction Properties > Origin:

The orgin is the center of the player character. One would normally have it centered. This helps with proper colision with tileset objects. EX: A tree. No one wants to bump into a tree 10 steps before it is reached.

![Chapter_4_9.1_Sprite_editor_sprite_direction_properties_origin_0.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_4_images/Chapter_4_9.1_Sprite_editor_sprite_direction_properties_origin_0.png)

I will change the origin from 12 x 23 to 6 x 12.

![Chapter_4_9_Sprite_editor_sprite_direction_properties_origin_1.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_4_images/Chapter_4_9_Sprite_editor_sprite_direction_properties_origin_1.png)

*The result:*

![Chapter_4_10_Sprite_editor_sprite_direction_properties_origin_2.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_4_images/Chapter_4_10_Sprite_editor_sprite_direction_properties_origin_2.png)

#####Resource Manager > Sprites > Sprite Editor > Direction Properties > Frames:

This is what it looks like when the frames are set to 8.

![Chapter_4_11_Sprite_editor_sprite_direction_properties_frames_1.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_4_images/Chapter_4_11_Sprite_editor_sprite_direction_properties_frames_1.png)

Now this is what it looks like when the frames are changed from 8 to 3.

![Chapter_4_12_Sprite_editor_sprite_direction_properties_frames_2.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_4_images/Chapter_4_12_Sprite_editor_sprite_direction_properties_frames_2.png)

#####Resource Manager > Sprites > Sprite Editor > Direction Properties > Columns:

This is what it looks like when the column is changed from 8 to 2.

![Chapter_4_14_Sprite_editor_sprite_direction_properties_columns_1.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_4_images/Chapter_4_14_Sprite_editor_sprite_direction_properties_columns_1.png)

![Chapter_4_15_Sprite_editor_sprite_direction_properties_columns_2.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_4_images/Chapter_4_15_Sprite_editor_sprite_direction_properties_columns_2.png)

###Setting up a Sprite:

Everyone needs to know how to setup a sprite. The Solarus Sprite editor is super amazing and makes this task easy as pie!

#####Making a Sprite:

Making a new sprite is first thing that needs to be done.

![chapter_4_sprite_setup_images/0_a_make_sprite.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_4_images/chapter_4_sprite_setup_images/0_a_make_sprite.png)

#####Name Sprite:

![chapter_4_sprite_setup_images/0_name_sprite.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_4_images/chapter_4_sprite_setup_images/0_name_sprite.png)

#####Create Animation:

![chapter_4_sprite_setup_images/1_create_animation.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_4_images/chapter_4_sprite_setup_images/1_create_animation.png)

#####Name Animation:

![chapter_4_sprite_setup_images/2_name_animation.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_4_images/chapter_4_sprite_setup_images/2_name_animation.png)

#####Load Sprite Image:

Click the pencil to load a image from te sprite directory.

![chapter_4_sprite_setup_images/3_load_slime_image_2.png.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_4_images/chapter_4_sprite_setup_images/3_load_slime_image_2.png.png)

![chapter_4_sprite_setup_images/3_load_slime_image.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_4_images/chapter_4_sprite_setup_images/3_load_slime_image.png)

#####Making Directions - Drag Click Release

Click one of the sprite image frames and add it as a new direction. This can be done by holding down the left mouse button and dragging to highlight one of the red slime sprites. The first sprite at the upper left corner would be best.

![chapter_4_sprite_setup_images/4_click_drag_release_1.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_4_images/chapter_4_sprite_setup_images/4_click_drag_release_1.png)

That creates a Direction called, "`Direction 0`."

![chapter_4_sprite_setup_images/5_direction_zero.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_4_images/chapter_4_sprite_setup_images/5_direction_zero.png)

Repeat this process until you get 4 frames.

![chapter_4_sprite_setup_images/6_repeat_until_four_directions.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_4_images/chapter_4_sprite_setup_images/6_repeat_until_four_directions.png)

#####Set Frame Delay & Loop

![chapter_4_sprite_setup_images/7_set_frame_delay_loop_it.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_4_images/chapter_4_sprite_setup_images/7_set_frame_delay_loop_it.png)

#####Set Columns, Rows, & Origin

We are using 4 frames, so column and rows are 4.

Origin should be fine at 8x8.

![chapter_4_sprite_setup_images/8_set_origin_row_column_4.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_4_images/chapter_4_sprite_setup_images/8_set_origin_row_column_4.png)

#####Show Origin

Click the check box to show the origin.

![chapter_4_sprite_setup_images/9_show_origin_centered.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_4_images/chapter_4_sprite_setup_images/9_show_origin_centered.png)

#####Zoom on Sprite

![chapter_4_sprite_setup_images/10_zoom.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_4_images/chapter_4_sprite_setup_images/10_zoom.png)

#####Previous & Next Sprite Frame

![Chapter_4_images/chapter_4_sprite_setup_images/11_previous_next_frame.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_4_images/chapter_4_sprite_setup_images/11_previous_next_frame.png)

#####Last & First Frame + Play & Stop

Previous and next are the arrows.

Stop is the button with the square and play is the triangle that is on its side.
