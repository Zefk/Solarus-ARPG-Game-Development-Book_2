This is a quick start for the "very" basics of lua and more will be added later based on examples in scripts.

Comments: 
You can make comments in a few ways in Lua. These are ignored by the code and one uses them to help themselves or others to understand the code.

Single comment:

You must put "--" before the text. 

Example:
--Hello

Multiple line comments:

You must use two dashes and opening plus closing brackets. -- [ [ ] ]
]]

--Example:

--[[
Write all the text you want between here.
--]]
