##Book Export Process:

**About:**

This book is being worked on in seperate markdown (.md) files on Linux using [Haroopad v0.13.1.](http://pad.haroopress.com/user.html)

I will only provide HTML, MD, and PDF for this book. Others are welcome to make epubs, mobi, azw, lit, etc.

**Putting the .md files together:**

1.The seperate .md files extension are renamed to .txt using a bulk rename software. 

2.The 'cat' command is used in the Linux terminal to combine the .txt files.

`cd 'directory'`

`cat *.txt > Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2`

3.The Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2.txt is renamed to Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2.md

4.A table of contents is added with Haroopad and the URLs are changed to folder directories.

5.The .md file is exported as an HTML file and printed with Chrome. The table of contents, images, code syntax, style/theme, and everything still works in the pdf exported from Chrome.
