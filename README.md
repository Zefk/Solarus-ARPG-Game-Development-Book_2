## Book Export Process:

**About:**

This book is being worked on in seperate markdown (.md) files on Linux using [Haroopad v0.13.1.](http://pad.haroopress.com/user.html)

I will only provide HTML and PDF for this book. Others are welcome to make epubs, mobi, azw, lit, etc.

**Putting the .md files together:**

1. The `.md` file extensions are renamed to `.txt` using a bulk rename software. (EX: Thunar Bulk Rename)

2. The 'cat' command is used in the Linux terminal to combine the `.txt` files.

`cd 'directory'`

`cat *.txt > Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2.md`

3. The `.md` file is exported as an HTML file and printed with Chrome. The table of contents, images, code syntax, style/theme, and everything still works in the pdf exported from Chrome.
