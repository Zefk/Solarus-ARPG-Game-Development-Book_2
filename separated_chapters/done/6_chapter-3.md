## Chapter 3: Moving Around The Solarus Editor

### First Appearance

The Solarus editor looks like this when one first opens it. This is before any quests are loaded or made.

### File

You will notice `file` at the upper left corner of the Solarus Editor. This is where one would make a new quest, load a quest,  close a quest, check recently loaded quests, close tabs, save game, and check the quest properties.
