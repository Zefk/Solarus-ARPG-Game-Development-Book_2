## Chapter 2: Free Graphics, audio, scripts, and Basic Free License Information

### Free Graphics & Audio

##### Sample Quest

Inside the Solarus Engine `Download` contains many free graphics, scripts, and audio in the sample quest. You can thank Diarandor for that because he is constantly adding resources to the sample quest.
