### Chapter 18:Sprite Artist Guide

This guide is just a few basic tips and tricks. The guide goes off of one already knowing about pixels and have made at least a simple front view of a sprite.

### Viewpoint

The viewpoints I am talking about are front, back, and side. I have met and seen a lot of people have trouble with other viewpoints once they complete the frontal view. This guide will work with most simple sprites.

##### Front View
I will use the frontal view of one of my elf sprites. This sprite is a remake from my old one.

![chapter_19_viewpoint_1_front_view.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_19_images/chapter_19_viewpoint_1_front_view.png)

##### Side view

I copy mostly half of the front view sprite right before the second eye.

![chapter_19_viewpoint_2_select_half_second_eye.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_19_images/chapter_19_viewpoint_2_select_half_second_eye.png)

It is copied as you can see here.

![chapter_19_viewpoint_3_Half_sprite.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_19_images/chapter_19_viewpoint_3_Half_sprite.png)

We want to copy the other part of the hair as well.

![chapter_19_viewpoint_4_grab_end_hair.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_19_images/chapter_19_viewpoint_4_grab_end_hair.png)

And add it onto the half copied sprite.

![chapter_19_viewpoint_5_side_end_hair.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_19_images/chapter_19_viewpoint_5_side_end_hair.png)

Starting with the face. We have to move the eye over by at least 1 pixel.

![chapter_19_viewpoint_6_move_eye_over.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_19_images/chapter_19_viewpoint_6_move_eye_over.png)

Set the hair border above the eye. It might be good to add a black eyebrow above the eye depending on the hair style. Not in this case though.

![chapter_19_viewpoint_7_set_hair_border.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_19_images/chapter_19_viewpoint_7_set_hair_border.png)

Set the border of the face and neck.

![chapter_19_viewpoint_8_set_face_neck_border.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_19_images/chapter_19_viewpoint_8_set_face_neck_border.png)

It should now look like this.

![chapter_19_viewpoint_9_now_this.pn](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_19_images/chapter_19_viewpoint_9_now_this.png)

Now in this case we add the chest area for the female. The chest is two black pixels that are 1 pixel across from the neck.

![chapter_19_viewpoint_10_breast_boob_border.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_19_images/chapter_19_viewpoint_10_breast_boob_border.png)

The chest needs to be lightened for better visibility and distinction between the other pixels and a border for the shoulder.

![chapter_19_viewpoint_11_set_chest_point.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_19_images/chapter_19_viewpoint_11_set_chest_point.png)

Afterward, the removal of the arm. Also, a black border going down from the breast starting point.

![chapter_19_viewpoint_12_select_arm.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_19_images/chapter_19_viewpoint_12_select_arm.png)

We now need to delete the extra black area and move the leg over.

![chapter_19_viewpoint_13_delete_it.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_19_images/chapter_19_viewpoint_13_delete_it.png)

However, the foot is too small and the thin leg makes the sprite look like a detailed toothpick. This usually does not happen if the heroine is wearing a dress or skirt.

![chapter_19_viewpoint_14_move_leg_over_delete_black_line.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_19_images/chapter_19_viewpoint_14_move_leg_over_delete_black_line.png)

Let us fix the foot first by bringing it out a little more.

![chapter_19_viewpoint_15_make_side_foot.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_19_images/chapter_19_viewpoint_15_make_side_foot.png)

Now why not just make it into a boot by deleting two black pixels in the front and adding some temporary gray. Also, add some black pixels up from the heel.

![chapter_19_viewpoint_16_boot_top_edge.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_19_images/chapter_19_viewpoint_16_boot_top_edge.png)

Next we will add some pants. Just a square with temporary striped pixels.

![chapter_19_viewpoint_17_make_square_pants.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_19_images/chapter_19_viewpoint_17_make_square_pants.png)

Next we select the upper body of the sprite.

![chapter_19_viewpoint_18_select_body.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_19_images/chapter_19_viewpoint_18_select_body.png)

And cut it, then move it over by one pixel. It is looking pretty good now.

![chapter_19_viewpoint_19_move_it_over.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_19_images/chapter_19_viewpoint_19_move_it_over.png)

Next we add a hand. It is just another square with a few shades of beige and black line of pixels.

![chapter_19_viewpoint_20_hand_waist.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_19_images/chapter_19_viewpoint_20_hand_waist.png)

Let us now darken up the boot top edge, but it could just be made brown.

![chapter_19_viewpoint_21_darken_boot_edge.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_19_images/chapter_19_viewpoint_21_darken_boot_edge.png)

After that, we should remove the stripes on the pants because it looks too plain or odd.

![chapter_19_viewpoint_22_darken_pant_center.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_19_images/chapter_19_viewpoint_22_darken_pant_center.png)

Also, increase the breast size to show that she is more womanly. It is kinda just a stereotype. This is done by adding another pixel with a few more shades of the pixel.

![chapter_19_viewpoint_23_make_boob_bigger.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_19_images/chapter_19_viewpoint_23_make_boob_bigger.png)

The sun is normally over head a person, so the light areas of the hair look better on the top or edges. A few shades of gray under that will give more realistic shade.

![chapter_19_viewpoint_24_light_top_shades.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_19_images/chapter_19_viewpoint_24_light_top_shades.png)

Next, add a brown necklace on her neck and flip her. This is done by mirror feature or flip tool in gimp. I think she looks pretty good for being so few pixels.

![chapter_19_viewpoint_25_flip_it.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_19_images/chapter_19_viewpoint_25_flip_it.png)

##### Back View

Firstly, we copy the front view because it will be almost exactly the same.

![chapter_19_viewpoint_26_copy_front.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_19_images/chapter_19_viewpoint_26_copy_front.png)

Secondly, the back is darkened because breasts on her back would be weird.

![chapter_19_viewpoint_27_darken_boob_area.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_19_images/chapter_19_viewpoint_27_darken_boob_area.png)

Thirdly, the hairstyle she will have. I am just going to pick a bun like hairstyle, so the black line of the hair needs to be stretched out.

![chapter_19_viewpoint_28_make_pony_edge.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_19_images/chapter_19_viewpoint_28_make_pony_edge.png)

Fourthly, the silver like pixels will stretch out the same way.

![chapter_19_viewpoint_29_light_color.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_19_images/chapter_19_viewpoint_29_light_color.png)

Fifthly, we cover the eyes up and repeat the black stretched pattern.

![chapter_19_viewpoint_30_repeat_patterm.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_19_images/chapter_19_viewpoint_30_repeat_patterm.png)

The 6th step is to darken the area of the second repeat of black lines and add black pixels out from the edges of the second repeat. They should be 1 pixel down.

![chapter_19_viewpoint_31_darken_around%20repeat.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_19_images/chapter_19_viewpoint_31_darken_around%20repeat.png)

The 7th step is to pick the end point for the hair. I just picked under the two sides of the hair hanging down. Next do a smaller repeat of black lines because we are at the end of the hair.

![chapter_19_viewpoint_32_shrink_repeat.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_19_images/chapter_19_viewpoint_32_shrink_repeat.png)

The 8th step is to remove the extra black pixels. The hair turned out pretty good.

![chapter_19_viewpoint_33_delete_black_area_spread_bun.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_19_images/chapter_19_viewpoint_33_delete_black_area_spread_bun.png)

##### Completed

![chapter_19_viewpoint_34_Finished.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_19_images/chapter_19_viewpoint_34_Finished.png)

##### Cropped

![chapter_19_viewpoint_35_cropped.pn](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_19_images/chapter_19_viewpoint_35_cropped.png)

### Dithering

Dithering is a technique of blending colors together.

![Chapter_19_images/chapter_19_36_dithering.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_19_images/chapter_19_36_dithering.png)

### Shading

There are plenty of ways to shade. Shading is the process of lighting and darkening certain areas. Some people like shading based on a light source and other just shade randomly. Shading does not always have to be correct to look good.

![Chapter_19_images/chapter_19_37_shading.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_19_images/chapter_19_37_shading.png)

### Selective Outlining

Selective outlining is used to show borders in a way independently of the
background color. Artists sometimes dithering these borders for dark backgrounds.

![Chapter_19_images/chapter_19_38_Selective_Outlining.png](https://github.com/Zefk/Solarus-ARPG-Game-Development-Book_2/raw/master/Lesson_images/Chapter_19_images/chapter_19_38_Selective_Outlining.png)
