### Fairyolica World Credits

I used the Fariryolica world tileset image as a preview. It is under CC-BY-SA 3.0.

##### About:

1.The bullet "•" means it is a person and the way they want to be credited. 

2.This is organized by license type. CC0, CC-BY 3.0, CC-BY-SA 3.0. 

3.CC0 is not required for crediting, but I added them anyway. 

4.Go into the original graphics for more detailed credits for each folder with related links. 

5.Yes, all these licenses are compatible with each other, but the end result is CC-BY-SA 3.0 

and you must credit everyone if you use the Fariyolica.png. That means the CC0 people too.

6.I refined this list a little. 11-14-16 [November 14th, 2016]
